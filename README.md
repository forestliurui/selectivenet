# Deep Neural Network with a Reject Option
This code repository contains code to build a deep neural network with a reject option, i.e., restrain from providing a valid prediction.

## Usage
To run an experiment run train.py --model_name [name] --baseline [name] --dataset [cifar_10/catsdogs/SVHN]

## Acknowledgement
This repository is adapted from the code repo for "SelectiveNet: A Deep Neural Network with an Integrated Reject Option"
